      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Lachlan Hughes, I am 26 years old, born and raised in South Australia. I have recently begun my journey to programming
        and I am excited to continue to grow. My personal hobbies include gaming, either solo or with friends. Gaming has also somewhat inspired me
        to persure programming, as sometimes coding can feel like a puzzle game. You know how the end result will look, its just a matter of putting the
        right pieces into place!
