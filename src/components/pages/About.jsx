        My name is Lachlan, a 26 year old male who is currently
        studying to become a software engineer. I am currently undertaking
        a bootcamp to help not only refreshen my skills, but to gain more
        knowledge about the field and help build up a portfolio.

        More about me on a personal note. I enjoy playing video games,
        with friends is best but also enjoy some single player games here and there.
        I really love anime and have been watching since back in 2010. I am currently
        living at home with my parents, brother and sister, along with our 2 cats.
