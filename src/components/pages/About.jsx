        <p>
          My name is Lachlan, a 26 year old male who is currently
          studying to become a software engineer. I am currently undertaking
          a bootcamp to help not only refreshen my skills, but to gain more
          knowledge about the field and help build up a portfolio.

          More about me on a personal note. I have been with my lovely girlfriend
          for just over a year and a half now. I enjoy playing video games,
          with friends is best but also enjoy some single player games here and there.
          I really love anime and have been watching since back in 2010. I am currently
          living at home with my parents, brother and sister, along with our 2 cats.
