Clicking on the buttons in the NavBar will take you to each section of the Portfolio page. About is the default page and will tell you a bit about myself. Portfolio shares some of the works I have created/worked on. Contact allows you to put your name, email and contact message in, which will be sent as an email notification to me. Resume has a list of my skills, education and work histroy. Down the bottom at the footer there are 3 buttons. The first will take you to my GitHub page.
